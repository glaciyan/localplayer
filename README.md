## 🏗 Architecture

This app follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and clear separation of concerns. Each layer has a distinct role and communicates only with adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces.

### Layers

- **🎨 Presentation Layer**  
  Handles everything related to the user interface: rendering widgets, reacting to state changes, and processing user input. It communicates with the application layer to trigger business logic and display results.

- **🧠 Application Layer**  
  Acts as the middleman between the UI and the core logic. It contains controllers and use cases that coordinate user actions, business processes, and communication with external services via abstract interfaces.

- **📦 Domain Layer**  
  Contains the pure business logic and definitions — including core entities, models, and abstract interfaces (e.g., for repositories or services). This layer is completely independent and testable on its own.

- **🗄 Data Layer**  
  Implements the interfaces defined in the domain layer. This includes network services, local storage, API clients, and data mapping logic that translates raw responses into domain models.
